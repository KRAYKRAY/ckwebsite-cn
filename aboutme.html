            <div class="about-me-answer">
                <p>I have a passion for graphics, photography, motion design, and technology. This has always been a part of my life as a hobby and always wanted to pursue my interest as a career. I spent nearly all my life just working from job to job and never thinking about what I wanted to do as a career. Long period of time I was in France I started to get more and more involved in my passion because of the people around me and the people I worked with. <br><br> I spent four months in India and was able to flourish and understand my strengths and motivation. Studying and photographing wildlife in their natural habitat was a truly life-changing experience and gave me the motivation to start a career as a graphic/motion designer. After a short period of returning from India, I returned to the UK. My career path completely changed and became a carer for a family member so the career in graphics was put on hold because it was very hard to do both.<br><br> Just over four years past as a carer and it got to a point where I could not do it anymore as professional care was needed. Since last year I been trying to get my self back on a correct path and the help I have been getting from Care Centre, which I have great contacts got me on this course with Code Nation. I have always wanted to learn to code but due to the learning load with graphics and motion design in the past, never looked into it in-till now.</p>
